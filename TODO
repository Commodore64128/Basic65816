Outstanding
-----------
- dumping out variables. Don't forget fast vars.
- accessing variables with auto-creation (not for arrays)

Fixes
-----
- allocating temp space, even size.
- allocating temp space, there is enough - do on allocation not reset.
- allocating concrete space (a$ = "hello" would not do temp space !)
- allocating variable space, there's enough
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- writing null strings all share the same one rather than concreting.
- garbage collection.
