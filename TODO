- UPPER$() LOWER$()
- LIST. Detokenising. Spacing out and tabs in.
- CALL <address> (params A,X,Y ?)
- Input code. Tokenising.
- Typing commands in
- Typing programs in

Public play:

- PROC <identifier> DEFPROC ENDPROC
- LOCALs 
- Parameters (not arrays ?)
- Switchable environments.

Fixes
-----
- 	check keyword actually a keyword 10 = works - it's a legal keyword :) 

- 	reset temporary storage pointer when typing things in, even if no command executed as error could
	occur if you do gosub 700.

- 	modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue. Seems to be different views on this (!)

- 	expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing. same for basic stack.

- 	reset stuff on error (not variables ?) - what about stop.

- 	garbage collection, moving string to its own position.

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
