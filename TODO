- LEFT$ RIGHT$ MID$
- UPPER$ LOWER$
- LIST. Detokenising. Spacing out and tabs in.
- CALL <address> (params A,X,Y,C ?)
- Input code. Tokenising.
- Typing commands in
- Typing programs in
- PROC <identifier> DEFPROC ENDPROC
- LOCALs 
- Parameters (not arrays)
- Switchable environments.
- 65816 assembler.
- Dog food !!

Fixes
-----
- 	reset temporary storage pointer when typing things in, even if no command executed as error could
	occur if you do gosub 700.

- 	expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing. same for basic stack.

- 	reset stuff on error (not variables ?) - what about stop.

- 	garbage collection, moving string to its own position doesn't need to be physically copied.

- 	allocating stack for FOR REPEAT WHILE IF

- 	fewer bytes allocate in convert to string for bases >= 10 (say)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
