Main
----
- update the test framework.
- changes.

Fixes
-----
- concreting null strings, use a space in the block for this which is always $00
  so we don't end up with lots of NULL strings to garbage collect.
- don't concrete strings that are in code space, not required.
- modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue.
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- garbage collection (not the specialist NULL strings, strings in high memory ONLY) 
- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even (?)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
