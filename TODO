- Dog food !!

- Parameters (not arrays)
- Switchable environments.
- 65816 assembler.
- Garbage collection, value on stack ???

Fixes
-----
- 	detokenising lines, too long ?

- 	expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing. same for basic stack.

- 	reset stuff on error (not variables ?) - what about stop ?

- 	garbage collection, moving string to its own position doesn't need to be physically copied.

- 	allocating stack for FOR REPEAT WHILE IF LOCAL PROC etc.

- 	fewer bytes allocate in convert to string for bases >= 10 (say)

(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- adding new lines, out of memory.

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
