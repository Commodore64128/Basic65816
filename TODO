Main
----
- Fix up error reporting. Add "OK."
- PRINT <string> <variable> ' (; on end)
- Add Stack which is reset on CLEAR etc.
- GOTO GOSUB RETURN ON..GOTO/GOSUB
- LIST ?
- Input code.
- PROC <identifier> ENDPROC


Fixes
-----
- modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue. Seems to be different views on this (!)

- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing

- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even (?)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
