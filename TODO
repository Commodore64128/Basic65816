Main
----
- VariableCreate routine
- test this works.
- rewrite the test framework (no arrays yet) to generate BASIC code not hard-write it in.
- array dimension, memory allocation, update the test framework.
- update the old dump memory code.
- remove magic constants (?)

Fixes
-----
- concreting null strings, use a space in the block for this which is always $00
  so we don't end up with lots of NULL strings to garbage collect.
- modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue.
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- garbage collection (not the specialist NULL strings !) 
- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even (?)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
