Main
----
- assignment automatic creation (variables only)
- test this works.
- rewrite the test framework (no arrays yet) to generate BASIC code.
- array dimension, memory allocation, update the test framework.
- update the old dump memory code.

Fixes
-----
- concreting null strings, use a space in the block for this which is always $00
  so we don't end up with lots of NULL strings.
- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even.
- allocating temp space, there is enough - do on allocation not reset.
- allocating concrete space (a$ = "hello" would not do temp space !)
- allocating variable space, there's enough
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- writing null strings all share the same one rather than concreting.
- garbage collection (not the specialist NULL strings !)
- modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue.
