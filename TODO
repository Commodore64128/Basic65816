- 	detokenising lines, too long ?

- 	expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing. same for basic stack.

- 	allocating stack for FOR REPEAT WHILE IF LOCAL PROC etc.

- 	fewer bytes allocate in convert to string for bases >= 10 (say)

(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- adding new lines, out of memory.

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory.
