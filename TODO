Main
----
- garbage collection
- work out next phase

Fixes
-----

- don't concrete strings that are in or are below code space, not required.
- modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue. Seems to be different views on this (!)
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- garbage collection (not the specialist NULL strings, strings in high memory ONLY) 
- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even (?)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
