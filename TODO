Main
----
- checking arithmetic, comparisons, functions etc. from random data (test)
- assignment and assignment creation. Concrete strings on assignment (!)
- array dimension.

Fixes
-----
- allocating temp space, even size so every address is even.
- allocating temp space, there is enough - do on allocation not reset.
- allocating concrete space (a$ = "hello" would not do temp space !)
- allocating variable space, there's enough
- expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing
- writing null strings all share the same one rather than concreting.
- garbage collection.
