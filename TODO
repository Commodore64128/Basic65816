Main
----

- ON..GOTO
- IF THEN ELSE ... ELSE ENDIF / WHILE WEND planning (also the +/- ing ??? ELSE no effect ?)
- LIST. Detokenising. Spacing out and in.
- Input code. Tokenising.
- Typing commands in
- Typing programs in
- PROC <identifier> DEFPROC ENDPROC

Fixes
-----
- 	reset temporary storage pointer when typing things in, even if no command executed as error could
	occur if you do gosub 700.

- 	modulus arithmetic error (test_math does not check %) sign issue. Seems to be different views on this (!)

- 	expressions stack sizes and spacing and testing. same for basic stack.

- 	reset stuff on error (not variables ?)

Memory Checks
=============
(all check LowMem vs HighMem)

- allocating new variable (memory error)

- when allocating space for temporary variables, check there isn't a collision (memory error)

- when concreting, check that doesn't run out of memory. Set a G/C flag if there isn't much 
  left.
